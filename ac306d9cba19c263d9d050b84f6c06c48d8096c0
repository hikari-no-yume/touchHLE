      "message": "I don\u0027t like how many allocations are going on here. That\u0027s one vector per PCM frame ðŸ˜±. The outer vector is a shame too, since it\u0027s not needed in the mono case.\n\nMaybe you could replace this with a for loop that does `out_pcm.extend_from_slice` with `.to_le_bytes()`. Alternatively, you could make an array on the stack, copy stuff into the array, and then extend using the array. The latter might be faster? *shrug*.\n\nBtw, it\u0027d also be neater if `.chunks(2)` was used for the stereo packet iteration, since this code is so iterator method heavy already.",
