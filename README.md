# touchHLE: high-level emulator for iPhone OS apps

**touchHLE** is a high-level emulator (HLE) for iPhone OS apps. It runs on modern desktop operating systems, and is written in Rust.

As an HLE, touchHLE is radically different from a low-level emulator (LLE) like QEMU. The only code the [emulated CPU](https://github.com/merryhime/dynarmic) executes is the app binary and [a handful of libraries](touchHLE_dylibs/); touchHLE takes the place of iPhone OS and provides its own implementations of the system frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, etc).

The goal of this project is to run games from the early days of iOS:

* Currently: iPhone and iPod touch apps for iPhone OS 2.x. [Three of these are known to work](APP_SUPPORT.md), and of course we are trying to make that list longer. :)
* Next: iPhone OS 3.0 support.
* Longer term: iPhone OS 3.1, iPad apps (iPhone OS 3.2), iOS 4.x, ‚Ä¶
* Never: 64-bit iOS.

Support for apps that aren't games isn't a priority: it's more complex and less fun.

## Platform support

* Officially supported: x64 Windows and x64 macOS.
  * These are the platforms with binary releases.
  * If you're an Apple Silicon Mac user, the x64 build reportedly works in Rosetta.
* Probably works, but you must build it yourself: AArch64 macOS, x64 Linux, AArch64 Linux.
* Never?: other architectures.

**Known issue on macOS: memory leak of approximately 0.2MB/second (30fps games) or 0.4MB/second (60fps games).** Despite best efforts, this hasn't been figured out. Thankfully this is slow enough that it shouldn't be a problem for most play sessions.

Android support is planned.

Input methods:

- For simulated touch input, there are two options:
  - Mouse/trackpad input (tap/hold/drag by pressing the left mouse button)
  - Virtual cursor using the right analog stick on a game controller (tap/hold/drag by pressing the stick or the right shoulder button)
- For simulated acceleremeter input, there are two options:
  - Tilt control simulation using the left analog stick of a game controller
  - Real accelerometer input, if you are using a phone, tablet or some other device with a built-in accelerometer (TODO: support game controllers with accelerometers)

## Development status

Real development started in December 2022, and this is so far [a single person](https://hikari.noyu.me/)'s full-time passion project. There's only been a handful of releases so far and no promises can be made about the future. Please be patient.

Currently, the supported functionality is not much more than what's needed by a handful of supported apps, although the code tries to be reasonably complete where it can. The completeness varies a lot between APIs, e.g. UIKit is easily the most hacky and incomplete of the large frameworks that have been implemented, whereas the OpenGL ES and OpenAL implementations are probably complete enough to cover a large number of early apps.

# Usage

First obtain touchHLE, either a [binary release](https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE/releases) or by building it yourself (see the next section).

You'll then need an app that you can run (check [the list of supported apps](APP_SUPPORT.md)). Note that the app binary must be decrypted to be usable.

There's no graphical user interface right now. If you're a Windows user and unfamiliar with the command line, these instructions may be helpful:

* The easiest and fastest thing to do is to drag and drop the app's `.ipa` file or `.app` folder onto `touchHLE.exe`.
* To configure the options, edit the `touchHLE_options.txt` file. To get a list of options, look in the `OPTIONS_HELP.txt` file.
* You can also run apps directly from the command line:
  1. Move the `.ipa` file or `.app` bundle to the same folder as `touchHLE.exe`.
  2. Hold the Shift key and right-click on the empty space in the folder window.
  3. Click ‚ÄúOpen with PowerShell‚Äù.
  4. Type `.\touchHLE.exe "YourAppNameHere.ipa"` (or `.app` as appropriate) and press Enter. If you want to specify options, add a space after the app name (outside the quotes) and then type the options, separated by spaces.

Currently language detection doesn't work on Windows. To change the language preference reported to the app, you can type `SET LANG=` followed by an ISO 639-1 language code, then press Enter, before running the app in the command line. Some common language codes are: `en` (English), `de` (Deutsch), `es` (espa√±ol), `fr` (fran√ßais), `it` (italiano) and `ja` (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û). Bear in mind that it's the app itself that determines which languages are supported, not the emulator.

Any data saved by the app (e.g. **saved games**) are stored in the `touchHLE_sandbox` folder.

If the emulator crashes almost immediately while running a game **listed as supported**, please check whether you have any overlays turned on like the Steam overlay, Discord overlay, RivaTuner Statistics Server, etc. Sadly, as useful as these tools are, they work by injecting themselves into other apps or games and don't always clean up after themselves, so they can break touchHLE‚Ä¶ it's not our fault. üò¢ Currently only RivaTuner Statistics Server is known to be a problem. If you find another overlay that doesn't work, please tell us about it.
