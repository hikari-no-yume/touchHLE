I actually started implementing the same thing locally but didn\u0027t finish it due to the same concern.\n\nMy concerns are:\n\n- How does it interact with translation? Presumably it can be flipped by the scale, but what order do they have to happen in for this to work?\n- Shouldn\u0027t it affect other drawing operations too? Are they all affected?\n- This is getting too complicated.\n\nI think this might be the point where we should just implement tranformation matrices already.\n\nI\u0027m willing to take a stab at this myself, if you want.",
