# Apps supported by touchHLE

This is a list of apps known to work in touchHLE right now.

For pretty screenshots and video, [check out the home page!](https://touchhle.org/)

Pay attention to the **supported versions**. Versions that haven't been tested might not work. For each listed version, the name in “quotes” is the display name (i.e. the name you'd see on the home screen), and the number is the bundle version number. If you're not sure which version of an app you have, you can look at the `App bundle info:` output when you run it in touchHLE.

_Scale hack supported_ means an app is compatible with the `--scale-hack=` option, which enables it to run with increased internal resolution. Assume that at least 2× and 3× scales work with no noticeable performance impact. Some apps have been tested at scales as high as 4K.

_Default button mappings_ means that touchHLE has pre-configured button mappings for the app, making it more convenient to use on a game controller. See [touchHLE\_default\_options.txt](touchHLE_default_options.txt) for details.

Performance is tested with release builds of touchHLE on a 2017 Retina MacBook, which is a fairly underpowered (passively cooled!) dual-core laptop. Your computer is probably faster.

  <summary>Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D (2008, Vivendi/Polarbit, App Store day-two title)</summary>

  - Working versions:
    - “CBNK3D” 1.0 (in-game version number: 0.7.5)
    - “Crash Kart” 1.0 (in-game version number: 0.7.6)
  - **Broken versions:**
    - “Crash Kart” 1.7.7 (in-game version number: 1.0.1)
  - The intro video that plays before the title screen is skipped.
  - Otherwise fully playable, everything works. Among other things:
    - Sound effects and music

  <summary>Fastlane Street Racing (2008, Atod AB)</summary>

  - Working versions:
    - “Fastlane” 2.0 (in-game version number: 1.20.0)
  - Known issue: the specular lighting effect on the cars only seems to appear on Android. This is probably an issue with touchHLE's GLES1-on-GL2 compatibility layer, which isn't needed on Android.
  - Otherwise fully playable, everything works. Among other things:
    - Sound effects and music
    - All game modes
    - Saving and playing back replays
    - Save game persistence (settings, unlocks, records)
  - High framerate, but with some frames dropped in loading tunnels
    - Known issue: touchHLE doesn't yet implement vsync or frame capping, so Fastlane often vastly exceeds 60fps, which is quite wasteful (see: <https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE/issues/143>)
  - Scale hack supported
  - Default button mappings
