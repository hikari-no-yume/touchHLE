      "message": "OK so I think the necessary changes are:\n\n- Check `[view isMultipleTouchEnabled]` here.\n- If it\u0027s false, check if there\u0027s already touches in the set.\n- If so, mention that we\u0027re ignoring the touch and simply don\u0027t deliver it to the view. It\u0027s not clear to me whether it should still be delivered somewhere, but that can be a `TODO` item maybe? You might want to add a check for `view \u003d\u003d nil` in `handle_touches_move` and `handle_touches_end`, though messaging `nil` does nothing so technically you wouldn\u0027t need to.\n\nMy plan was to implement this myself, but I realised the changes are so small that it feels weird to credit myself as a co-author.",
