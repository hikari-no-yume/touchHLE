# Code-level (HLE)
- **ipasim** (2017) is a high level emulator written in C++ that uses Microsoft's winObjC to recompile 64-bit iOS apps into apps in live. It doesn't support much apps except for really basic ones. It was more focused on apps then games.

- **unidbg** (2020) is a developer library that allows emulating Android binaries, however "expiramental" iOS support was added some time in 2021. [Source code](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg)
# Middle-level or other
- **macOS 11+** (2020-present) on Apple Silicon architexures, which are are not virtualisable yet can run iOS apps, altough you need a few workarounds to sideload some apps. Emulation is basically perfect. [Website](http://apple.com/macos)
- **Cycada** (2014), formally known as Cider is an unreleased reasearch project made by a few folks at Columbia.

# Scams
Basically any other tool that claims to emulate iOS on any other platform is most likely a scam. It either is completely fake and a malware or just is an interface that looks like iOS. One of the most popular scams is called iPadian, which is a paid iOS simulator.
