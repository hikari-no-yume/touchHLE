# Code-level (HLE)
- **ipasim** (2017) is a high level emulator written in C++ that uses Microsoft's winObjC to recompile 64-bit iOS apps into apps in live. It doesn't support much apps except for really basic ones. It was more focused on apps then games.

- **unidbg** (2020) is a developer library that allows emulating Android binaries, however "expiramental" iOS support was added some time in 2021. It is unknown if any apps are supported. [Source code](https://github.com/zhkl0228/unidbg)
# Middle-level or other
- **macOS 11+** (2020-present) on Apple Silicon architexures, which are are not virtualisable yet can run iOS apps, altough you need a few workarounds to sideload some apps. Only supports 64-bit apps. Emulation is basically perfect. [Website](http://apple.com/macos) - [Sideloady](https://sideloadly.io/)
- **Cycada** (2014), formally known as Cider is an unreleased reasearch project made by a few folks at Columbia that ran iOS 5.1.1 and experimentally iOS 6 apps at a high, but not perfect quality and compatibility (see paper for list). It is based on pirated iOS libraries. It is seriously not reccomended to initiate contact with the developers of the project, as they never planned on releasing it and want people to use their paper to reproduce it with "significant effort". You may try to recreate Cycada on your own, provided that you know the internals of Android, iOS, XNU, and Linux.

# Device-level (emulation)
- **QEMU (devos50's fork)** (2022), an iPod Touch 1st generation emulated in QEMU able to run iPhoneOS 1, abeit sometimes crashing and with some missing features including audio and networking. The blog posts include a video and screenshots of the emulator. The creator is currently working on supporting iPhoneOS 2 and the iPod Touch 2G. This is the most reccomended touchHLE alternitive as it is both released and targets old iOS.

- **Corellium** (2019), a service made by the Isrealian company of the same name that runs any modern iOS devices, some Android devices, or bring-your-own IoT devices on either the cloud or a self hosted server. Emulation is basically perfect, and they have hardware iOS 10.3 to the latest iOS version, with debugging features and security tools, as well as IPA installing. They also have iPhone 7 to the latest iPhone in terms of hardware. The devices run on an ARM hypervisor. For individuals, it costs 99 USD for 2 cores, which only has iPhone 7, and 295 USD for 6 cores, to use modern iPhones. The site also prohibits users under 18 from using their service. The service is also made for cybersecurity, not gaming. [Website](https://corellium.com/)
- **QEMU-t8030** (2022), also known as TruEmu, is an iPhone 11 emulated in QEMU, however it does not have a display yet, and seems abandoned. [Source code](https://github.com/TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030) - [Presentation](https://i.blackhat.com/USA-22/Thursday/US-22-Nguyen-TruEmu.pdf)
- **QEMU-s5l89xx-port** (2012), also known as iEmu is another failed attempt to get an iPhone running in QEMU, this time the 1st generation. The last commits were made in 2013. [Source Code Mirror (Up to late 2012)](https://github.com/danzatt/QEMU-s5l89xx-port) - [Website (archived)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131213053331/http://www.iemu.org/index.php/Main_Page) - [Source Code (Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20130410061346/https://github.com/cmwdotme/QEMU-s5l89xx-port)
- **MAME** (1997), has VERY basic support for the 1st generation iPhone, and the iPhone support is abandoned.
# Scams
Basically any other tool that claims to emulate iOS on any other platform is most likely a scam. It either is completely fake and a malware or just is an interface that looks like iOS. One of the most popular scams is called iPadian, which is a paid iOS simulator.
