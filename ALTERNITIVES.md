# Code-level (HLE)
- 'ipasim' (2017) is a high level emulator written in C++ that uses Microsoft's winObjC to recompile 64-bit iOS apps into apps in live. It doesn't support much apps except for really basic ones. It was more focused on apps then games. [Source code](https://github.com/ipasimulator/ipasim)

# Scams
Basically any other tool that claims to emulate iOS on any other platform is most likely a scam. It either is completely fake and a malware or just is an interface that looks like iOS. One of the most popular scams is called iPadian, which is a paid iOS simulator.
