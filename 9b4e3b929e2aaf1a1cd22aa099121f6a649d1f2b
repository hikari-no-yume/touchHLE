      "message": "What if there\u0027s zero-padding, or no padding? I think there might need to be several more branches in these nested `if`s, though I would suggest replacing them all with one big `match` on a tuple like `(pad_width, pad_char, float_precision)` to make it more manageable. Maybe it could also be simplified by always providing a pad width, so we don\u0027t need a branch for that.\n\n(If only we could directly construct a `std::fmt::Formatter`â€¦ alas it seems to be impossible ðŸ˜¢)",
